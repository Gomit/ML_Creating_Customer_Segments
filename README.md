## Getting Started

In this project, you will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in *monetary units*) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

The dataset for this project can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). For the purposes of this project, the features `'Channel'` and `'Region'` will be excluded in the analysis â€” with focus instead on the six product categories recorded for customers.

Run the code block below to load the wholesale customers dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported.


```python
# Import libraries necessary for this project
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames

# Import supplementary visualizations code visuals.py
import visuals as vs

# Pretty display for notebooks
%matplotlib inline

# Load the wholesale customers dataset
try:
    data = pd.read_csv("customers.csv")
    data.drop(['Region', 'Channel'], axis = 1, inplace = True)
    print "Wholesale customers dataset has {} samples with {} features each.".format(*data.shape)
except:
    print "Dataset could not be loaded. Is the dataset missing?"
```

    Wholesale customers dataset has 440 samples with 6 features each.


## Data Exploration
In this section, you will begin exploring the data through visualizations and code to understand how each feature is related to the others. You will observe a statistical description of the dataset, consider the relevance of each feature, and select a few sample data points from the dataset which you will track through the course of this project.

Run the code block below to observe a statistical description of the dataset. Note that the dataset is composed of six important product categories: **'Fresh'**, **'Milk'**, **'Grocery'**, **'Frozen'**, **'Detergents_Paper'**, and **'Delicatessen'**. Consider what each category represents in terms of products you could purchase.


```python
# Display a description of the dataset
display(data.describe())
```

### Implementation: Selecting Samples
To get a better understanding of the customers and how their data will transform through the analysis, it would be best to select a few sample data points and explore them in more detail. In the code block below, add **three** indices of your choice to the `indices` list which will represent the customers to track. It is suggested to try different sets of samples until you obtain customers that vary significantly from one another.


```python
# TODO: Select three indices of your choice you wish to sample from the dataset
#indices = list(range(350, 400))
indices = [47,66,356]
#[39,51,41,52,53,54,55]

# Create a DataFrame of the chosen samples
samples = pd.DataFrame(data.loc[indices], columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True)
print "Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:"
display(samples)
```

    Chosen samples of wholesale customers dataset:

### Question 1
Consider the total purchase cost of each product category and the statistical description of the dataset above for your sample customers.  
*What kind of establishment (customer) could each of the three samples you've chosen represent?*  
**Hint:** Examples of establishments include places like markets, cafes, and retailers, among many others. Avoid using names for establishments, such as saying *"McDonalds"* when describing a sample customer as a restaurant.

**Answer:**

From the printed table we can hypothesise the following:

**row0:**
The establishment on row 0, in actuality the 47th row, was chosen due to it's large spending amount. On some product categories it spends 10-1000x more than other customers. 
From this I would guess the type of establishment represented on row 0 is some sort of retailer. 

**row1:**
The establishment on row 1, in actuality the 66th row, was chosen due to it's low spending amount. The majority of its purchases are in *Milk, Grocery* and *Detergents_Paper* which constitute 98% of its spending amount.
For this reason I would guess the type of establishment represented on row 1 is some sort of grocery store. 

**row2:**
The establishment on row 2, in actuality the 356th row, was chosen due to it's skewed distributed spending amount. The majority of its purchases are in the *Fresh* category which constitute 85% of its spending amount.
For this reason I would guess the type of establishment that operates on row 2 is some sort of fresh food market. 

### Implementation: Feature Relevance
One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign `new_data` a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the `DataFrame.drop` function.
 - Use `sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Use the removed feature as your target label. Set a `test_size` of `0.25` and set a `random_state`.
 - Import a decision tree regressor, set a `random_state`, and fit the learner to the training data.
 - Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's `score` function.


```python
from sklearn.cross_validation import train_test_split
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

def fun(feature,data):
    # TODO: Make a copy of the DataFrame, using the 'drop' function to drop the given feature
    new_data = data.drop([feature], axis=1)

    # TODO: Split the data into training and testing sets using the given feature as the target
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(new_data,data[feature], test_size=0.25, random_state=42)

    # TODO: Create a decision tree regressor and fit it to the training set
    
    regressor = DecisionTreeRegressor()
    
    regressor.fit(X_train,y_train)
    
    # TODO: Report the score of the prediction using the testing set
    score = regressor.score(X_test, y_test)
    print("The score for feature {:20}{:+.5f}".format(feature, score))

for i in data.columns.values:
    fun(i,data)
    

```

    The score for feature Fresh               -0.43896
    The score for feature Milk                +0.17780
    The score for feature Grocery             +0.69930
    The score for feature Frozen              -0.25941
    The score for feature Detergents_Paper    +0.48354
    The score for feature Delicatessen        -11.88000


### Question 2
*Which feature did you attempt to predict? What was the reported prediction score? Is this feature is necessary for identifying customers' spending habits?*  
**Hint:** The coefficient of determination, `R^2`, is scored between 0 and 1, with 1 being a perfect fit. A negative `R^2` implies the model fails to fit the data.

**Answer:**

The following scores were predicted by the DecisiontreeRegression classification:

|Feature           |      Score|
|:----------------:|:---------:|
|Fresh             |   -0.34638|
|Milk              |   +0.24867|
|Grocery           |   +0.69438|
|Frozen            |   -0.28147|
|Detergents_Paper  |   +0.32482|
|Delicatessen      |   -2.43433|

The feature that stands out is **Grocery** with a positive score of 0.69, stating that the other features have a significant enough impact on the amount of Grocery the buyer will be purchasing.

Further Milk and Detergents_Paper in addition to Grocery are the only features positively affected by the other features, indicating that these features are of most interest when trying to understand customers' spending habit. 

### Visualize Feature Distributions
To get a better understanding of the dataset, we can construct a scatter matrix of each of the six product features present in the data. If you found that the feature you attempted to predict above is relevant for identifying a specific customer, then the scatter matrix below may not show any correlation between that feature and the others. Conversely, if you believe that feature is not relevant for identifying a specific customer, the scatter matrix might show a correlation between that feature and another feature in the data. Run the code block below to produce a scatter matrix.


```python
# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of features in the data
pd.scatter_matrix(data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
```


![png](images/output_16_0.png)


### Question 3
*Are there any pairs of features which exhibit some degree of correlation? Does this confirm or deny your suspicions about the relevance of the feature you attempted to predict? How is the data for those features distributed?*  
**Hint:** Is the data normally distributed? Where do most of the data points lie? 

**Answer:**

Just from viewing the graph we can see that the clearest correlation is between Grocery category and Detergent_paper, there also seems to be a clear correlation between Grocery and Milk. In addition, Milk and Detergants_paper also seems to have a slight correlation.

From the graphs we can also see that the Delicatessen category paint a clear picture, where no matter how much expenditure is put on Delicatessen, none of the other categories seems to be positively affected. 

these observations are consistent with our previous calculations, the Grocery, Milk and Detegrents_Paper are affected most by the other features, and also that Delicatessen is least affected by any other feature.

## Data Preprocessing
In this section, you will preprocess the data to create a better representation of customers by performing a scaling on the data and detecting (and optionally removing) outliers. Preprocessing data is often times a critical step in assuring that results you obtain from your analysis are significant and meaningful.

### Implementation: Feature Scaling
If data is not normally distributed, especially if the mean and median vary significantly (indicating a large skew), it is most [often appropriate](http://econbrowser.com/archives/2014/02/use-of-logarithms-in-economics) to apply a non-linear scaling â€” particularly for financial data. One way to achieve this scaling is by using a [Box-Cox test](http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.stats.boxcox.html), which calculates the best power transformation of the data that reduces skewness. A simpler approach which can work in most cases would be applying the natural logarithm.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign a copy of the data to `log_data` after applying logarithmic scaling. Use the `np.log` function for this.
 - Assign a copy of the sample data to `log_samples` after applying logarithmic scaling. Again, use `np.log`.


```python
# TODO: Scale the data using the natural logarithm
log_data = np.log(data)

# TODO: Scale the sample data using the natural logarithm
#log_samples = np.log(log_data)
log_samples = pd.DataFrame(log_data.loc[indices], columns = data.keys()).reset_index(drop = True)

# Produce a scatter matrix for each pair of newly-transformed features
pd.scatter_matrix(log_data, alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
```


![png](images/output_21_0.png)


### Observation
After applying a natural logarithm scaling to the data, the distribution of each feature should appear much more normal. For any pairs of features you may have identified earlier as being correlated, observe here whether that correlation is still present (and whether it is now stronger or weaker than before).

Run the code below to see how the sample data has changed after having the natural logarithm applied to it.


```python
# Display the log-transformed sample data
display(log_samples)
```

### Implementation: Outlier Detection
Detecting outliers in the data is extremely important in the data preprocessing step of any analysis. The presence of outliers can often skew results which take into consideration these data points. There are many "rules of thumb" for what constitutes an outlier in a dataset. Here, we will use [Tukey's Method for identfying outliers](http://datapigtechnologies.com/blog/index.php/highlighting-outliers-in-your-data-with-the-tukey-method/): An *outlier step* is calculated as 1.5 times the interquartile range (IQR). A data point with a feature that is beyond an outlier step outside of the IQR for that feature is considered abnormal.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign the value of the 25th percentile for the given feature to `Q1`. Use `np.percentile` for this.
 - Assign the value of the 75th percentile for the given feature to `Q3`. Again, use `np.percentile`.
 - Assign the calculation of an outlier step for the given feature to `step`.
 - Optionally remove data points from the dataset by adding indices to the `outliers` list.

**NOTE:** If you choose to remove any outliers, ensure that the sample data does not contain any of these points!  
Once you have performed this implementation, the dataset will be stored in the variable `good_data`.


```python
# For each feature find the data points with extreme high or low values

Outliers =[]
existing = dict()

dub = set()

for feature in log_data.keys():
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q1 (25th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q1 = np.percentile(log_data[feature], 25)
    
    # TODO: Calculate Q3 (75th percentile of the data) for the given feature
    Q3 = np.percentile(log_data[feature], 75)
    
    # TODO: Use the interquartile range to calculate an outlier step (1.5 times the interquartile range)
    iqr = Q3-Q1
    step = 1.5*iqr
    
    # Display the outliers
    print "Data points considered outliers for the feature '{}':".format(feature)
    display(log_data[~((log_data[feature] >= Q1 - step) & (log_data[feature] <= Q3 + step))])
    
    for Item in log_data[~((log_data[feature] >= Q1 - step) & (log_data[feature] <= Q3 + step))].index.values:  
        if Item in existing:
            dub.add(Item)
            ItemNumber = existing[Item]
        else:
            ItemNumber = existing[Item] = len(Outliers)
            Outliers.append(Item)
```

    Data points considered outlier for more than 1 feature: [128, 65, 154, 75, 66]
    Total number of outliers '42':
    Percentage of total dataset 10%:


Let's view the distribution of the data as well as how strongley the features affect each other. 


```python
for i in log_data.loc[Outliers].columns.values:
    fun(i,log_data.loc[Outliers])
    
#pd.scatter_matrix(log_data.loc[Outliers], alpha = 0.3, figsize = (14,8), diagonal = 'kde');
```

    The score for feature Fresh               -2.00959
    The score for feature Milk                +0.52634
    The score for feature Grocery             -0.56933
    The score for feature Frozen              -0.08741
    The score for feature Detergents_Paper    +0.57489
    The score for feature Delicatessen        -0.78291



```python
# OPTIONAL: Select the indices for data points you wish to remove
outliers  = Outliers

# Remove the outliers, if any were specified
good_data = log_data.drop(log_data.index[outliers]).reset_index(drop = True)
```

### Question 4
*Are there any data points considered outliers for more than one feature based on the definition above? Should these data points be removed from the dataset? If any data points were added to the `outliers` list to be removed, explain why.* 

**Answer:**

Yes there are many data points considered outliers, these are created by a total of 42 entries. 
Out of the 42 entries 5 are have more than one outlier data point, namely [128, 65, 154, 75, 66]. 

After careful considerations i have chosen to remove all of the entries containing outliers, the reason for this being to focus on the bulk of the data entries. The 42 entries contributes to 10% of the total data set. And i'm sure a lot of relevant information could be going lost by doing this, however, i have decided to focus my attention of the 90% of data points that contributes to the majority of data and does not pose any problems later in the analysis. This includes the 5 entries that have outliers in multiple positions, which could have been an interesting phenomenon to study closer, and may not be a result of data errors but rather a different customer segment.

## Feature Transformation
In this section you will use principal component analysis (PCA) to draw conclusions about the underlying structure of the wholesale customer data. Since using PCA on a dataset calculates the dimensions which best maximize variance, we will find which compound combinations of features best describe customers.


```python

```

### Implementation: PCA

Now that the data has been scaled to a more normal distribution and has had any necessary outliers removed, we can now apply PCA to the `good_data` to discover which dimensions about the data best maximize the variance of features involved. In addition to finding these dimensions, PCA will also report the *explained variance ratio* of each dimension â€” how much variance within the data is explained by that dimension alone. Note that a component (dimension) from PCA can be considered a new "feature" of the space, however it is a composition of the original features present in the data.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Import `sklearn.decomposition.PCA` and assign the results of fitting PCA in six dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.


```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with the same number of dimensions as features
nrcol = good_data.shape[1]
pca = PCA(n_components=nrcol).fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Generate PCA results plot
pca_results = vs.pca_results(good_data, pca)


```

### Question 5
*How much variance in the data is explained* ***in total*** *by the first and second principal component? What about the first four principal components? Using the visualization provided above, discuss what the first four dimensions best represent in terms of customer spending.*  
**Hint:** A positive increase in a specific dimension corresponds with an *increase* of the *positive-weighted* features and a *decrease* of the *negative-weighted* features. The rate of increase or decrease is based on the indivdual feature weights.

**Answer:**

Approximately 72% of the variance is explained by the first two PC. And the first four PC stands for 90% of the variance.

Interpretation the graph:

The visualization above represents the linear coefficients for each feature of the components. Feature weight values (y-axis) close to 1 or -1 indicate that the corresponding feature have a strong impact on the components value. Feature weight values near 0 indicate that the corresponding feature have no impact. 

- Dimension 1

Detergents_Paper feature stand for the largest impact on the component value, at approximately 0.78. Grocery and Milk has the second most influence on the component value at approximately 0.45 and 0.4 respectively. This gives the impression that the component works within the retail business.

- Dimension 2

The three features Fresh, Frozen and delicatess account for the majority impact on this component value. Milk and Grocery does not have much influence and Detergent_paper barely registers. This component resembles a restaurant business or cafÃ©.

- Dimension 3

The feature Fresh stands out on this components, reaching approximately 0.78 in feature weight value. Secondly Delicatessen also has an influence on the component with a negative value of -0.55. This component would be described as a retailer selling special Deli food.

- Dimension 4

The two most impactful features on this component are Frozen and Delicatessen, with 0.7 and negative -0.55 respectively. These components are then followed by Detergent_Paper and Fresh with 0.3 and negative 0.25 respectively. This component can be described as a retailer spending on of-the-shelf Frozen goods.

### Observation
Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it in six dimensions. Observe the numerical value for the first four dimensions of the sample points. Consider if this is consistent with your initial interpretation of the sample points.


```python
# Display sample log-data after having a PCA transformation applied
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = pca_results.index.values))

### Implementation: Dimensionality Reduction
When using principal component analysis, one of the main goals is to reduce the dimensionality of the data â€” in effect, reducing the complexity of the problem. Dimensionality reduction comes at a cost: Fewer dimensions used implies less of the total variance in the data is being explained. Because of this, the *cumulative explained variance ratio* is extremely important for knowing how many dimensions are necessary for the problem. Additionally, if a signifiant amount of variance is explained by only two or three dimensions, the reduced data can be visualized afterwards.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Assign the results of fitting PCA in two dimensions with `good_data` to `pca`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `good_data` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `reduced_data`.
 - Apply a PCA transformation of `log_samples` using `pca.transform`, and assign the results to `pca_samples`.


```python
# TODO: Apply PCA by fitting the good data with only two dimensions
pca = PCA(n_components=2).fit(good_data)

# TODO: Transform the good data using the PCA fit above
reduced_data = pca.transform(good_data)

# TODO: Transform log_samples using the PCA fit above
pca_samples = pca.transform(log_samples)

# Create a DataFrame for the reduced data
reduced_data = pd.DataFrame(reduced_data, columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2'])
```

### Observation
Run the code below to see how the log-transformed sample data has changed after having a PCA transformation applied to it using only two dimensions. Observe how the values for the first two dimensions remains unchanged when compared to a PCA transformation in six dimensions.


```python
# Display sample log-data after applying PCA transformation in two dimensions
display(pd.DataFrame(np.round(pca_samples, 4), columns = ['Dimension 1', 'Dimension 2']))
```


<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>Dimension 1</th>
      <th>Dimension 2</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <th>0</th>

      <td>1.3294</td>
      <td>-7.2150</td>
    </tr>

## Visualizing a Biplot
A biplot is a scatterplot where each data point is represented by its scores along the principal components. The axes are the principal components (in this case `Dimension 1` and `Dimension 2`). In addition, the biplot shows the projection of the original features along the components. A biplot can help us interpret the reduced dimensions of the data, and discover relationships between the principal components and original features.

Run the code cell below to produce a biplot of the reduced-dimension data.


```python
# Create a biplot
vs.biplot(good_data, reduced_data, pca)
```




    <matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x1194ff310>




![png](images/output_45_1.png)


### Observation

Once we have the original feature projections (in red), it is easier to interpret the relative position of each data point in the scatterplot. For instance, a point in the lower right corner of the figure will likely correspond to a customer that spends a lot on `'Milk'`, `'Grocery'` and `'Detergents_Paper'`, but not so much on the other product categories. 

From the biplot, which of the original features are most strongly correlated with the first component? What about those that are associated with the second component? Do these observations agree with the pca_results plot you obtained earlier?

## Clustering

In this section, you will choose to use either a K-Means clustering algorithm or a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm to identify the various customer segments hidden in the data. You will then recover specific data points from the clusters to understand their significance by transforming them back into their original dimension and scale. 

### Question 6
*What are the advantages to using a K-Means clustering algorithm? What are the advantages to using a Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm? Given your observations about the wholesale customer data so far, which of the two algorithms will you use and why?*

**Answer:**

**k-means**

K-means is a clustering algorithm, i.e. a way of partitioning a set of data points into "clusters," or sets of data points which are similar to one another. It works by iteratively reassigning data points to clusters and computing cluster centers based on the average of the point locations. It is commonly used for vector quantization and as an initialization for Gaussian mixture models.

**Gaussian Mixture model (GMM)**

Mixture of Gaussians is a probabilistic model commonly used for clustering: partitioning a set of data points into a set of clusters, where data points within a cluster are similar to one another.

**Differences**

Gaussian mixture models and K-means are two canonical approaches to clustering, i.e. dividing data points into meaningful groups. This concept node discusses the tradeoffs between them.

*K-means:*
- hard assignment: each object belongs to only one cluster
- the model are centroids only, no covariances or variances are taken into account

*Mixture modeling, GMM:*

- soft assignment: probability that an object belongs to a cluster

In Hard-K means, the observed points can only belong in a single cluster. However, it may be useful to consider the probability during the computation of nearest points. This is especially true for the points near a boundary between two clusters.

In general, the advantage of Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) over k-means is that GMMs deliver a soft-assignment of clusters. That is, each data point is assigned a probability for each cluster, indicating how likely it belongs to the cluster. GMMs can also fit more complex cluster shapes since each mixture component can freely fit its covariance matrix. 

Time:

- The advantage of k-means compared to GMMs is that it is much faster. k-means only maintains cluster centers (linear in number of features). Therefore k-means will be much quicker to train.

- For GMMs, many parameters must be fitted to the data (quadratic in the number of features). Therefore GMM will have a slower running time.


**Conclusion:**
Based on this information, and from the graph presented in "Visualizing a Biplot" i can see that the clusters are not clearly separated, this means a lot of points will be near a boundary between two clusters if i use k-means, which makes me prefer GMM. In addition, since the dataset does not contain too many data points, my final choice for clustering model is GMMs.


### Implementation: Creating Clusters
Depending on the problem, the number of clusters that you expect to be in the data may already be known. When the number of clusters is not known *a priori*, there is no guarantee that a given number of clusters best segments the data, since it is unclear what structure exists in the data â€” if any. However, we can quantify the "goodness" of a clustering by calculating each data point's *silhouette coefficient*. The [silhouette coefficient](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score.html) for a data point measures how similar it is to its assigned cluster from -1 (dissimilar) to 1 (similar). Calculating the *mean* silhouette coefficient provides for a simple scoring method of a given clustering.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Fit a clustering algorithm to the `reduced_data` and assign it to `clusterer`.
 - Predict the cluster for each data point in `reduced_data` using `clusterer.predict` and assign them to `preds`.
 - Find the cluster centers using the algorithm's respective attribute and assign them to `centers`.
 - Predict the cluster for each sample data point in `pca_samples` and assign them `sample_preds`.
 - Import `sklearn.metrics.silhouette_score` and calculate the silhouette score of `reduced_data` against `preds`.
   - Assign the silhouette score to `score` and print the result.


```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score
from sklearn.mixture import GMM

def score_clustering(data, num_clusters):
    preds, _, _  = cluster(data, num_clusters)
    score = silhouette_score(data, preds)
    return score

def cluster(data, num_clusters):
    clusterer = GMM(n_components=num_clusters, random_state=42).fit(data)
    preds = clusterer.predict(data)
    centers = clusterer.means_
    sample_preds = clusterer.predict(pca_samples)
    return preds, centers, sample_preds

for num_clusters in range(2,13):
    score = score_clustering(reduced_data, num_clusters)
    print("num_clusters: {} - score: {}".format(num_clusters, score))
```

    num_clusters: 2 - score: 0.443601474015
    num_clusters: 3 - score: 0.357294514249
    num_clusters: 4 - score: 0.291646368377
    num_clusters: 5 - score: 0.267990116649
    num_clusters: 6 - score: 0.307122866447
    num_clusters: 7 - score: 0.301835597658
    num_clusters: 8 - score: 0.312615487024
    num_clusters: 9 - score: 0.283717242517
    num_clusters: 10 - score: 0.246720539489
    num_clusters: 11 - score: 0.190964157253
    num_clusters: 12 - score: 0.232825455006


### Question 7
*Report the silhouette score for several cluster numbers you tried. Of these, which number of clusters has the best silhouette score?* 

**Answer:**

The best value is 1 and the worst value is -1. Values near 0 indicate overlapping clusters. Negative values generally indicate that a sample has been assigned to the wrong cluster, as a different cluster is more similar.

|num_clusters | score          |
|:-----------:|:-----:         |
|**2**        | **0.443601474015** |
|3            | 0.357294514249 |
|4            | 0.291646368377 |
|5            | 0.267990116649 |
|6            | 0.307122866447 |
|7            | 0.301835597658 |
|8            | 0.312615487024 |
|9            | 0.283717242517 |
|10           | 0.246720539489 |
|11           | 0.190964157253 |
|12           | 0.232825455006 |

**From the table above we can see that the top scorer had 2 clusters**

### Cluster Visualization
Once you've chosen the optimal number of clusters for your clustering algorithm using the scoring metric above, you can now visualize the results by executing the code block below. Note that, for experimentation purposes, you are welcome to adjust the number of clusters for your clustering algorithm to see various visualizations. The final visualization provided should, however, correspond with the optimal number of clusters. 


```python
preds, centers, sample_preds = cluster(reduced_data, 2)
vs.cluster_results(reduced_data, preds, centers, pca_samples)
```


![png](images/output_55_0.png)



```python
# Display the results of the clustering from implementation
vs.cluster_results(reduced_data, preds, centers, pca_samples)
```


![png](images/output_56_0.png)


### Implementation: Data Recovery
Each cluster present in the visualization above has a central point. These centers (or means) are not specifically data points from the data, but rather the *averages* of all the data points predicted in the respective clusters. For the problem of creating customer segments, a cluster's center point corresponds to *the average customer of that segment*. Since the data is currently reduced in dimension and scaled by a logarithm, we can recover the representative customer spending from these data points by applying the inverse transformations.

In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:
 - Apply the inverse transform to `centers` using `pca.inverse_transform` and assign the new centers to `log_centers`.
 - Apply the inverse function of `np.log` to `log_centers` using `np.exp` and assign the true centers to `true_centers`.



```python
# TODO: Inverse transform the centers
log_centers = pca.inverse_transform(centers)

# TODO: Exponentiate the centers
true_centers = np.exp(log_centers)

# Display the true centers
segments = ['Segment {}'.format(i) for i in range(0,len(centers))]
true_centers = pd.DataFrame(np.round(true_centers), columns = data.keys())
true_centers.index = segments
display(true_centers)
```

      <td>3546.0</td>
      <td>1159.0</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

</div>


### Question 8
Consider the total purchase cost of each product category for the representative data points above, and reference the statistical description of the dataset at the beginning of this project. *What set of establishments could each of the customer segments represent?*  
**Hint:** A customer who is assigned to `'Cluster X'` should best identify with the establishments represented by the feature set of `'Segment X'`.

**Answer:**

Using the following syntax, let's first print out the mean of each category.
**display(true_centers.describe().iloc[[1]])**


|         |       Fresh |	Milk |	Grocery |	Frozen |	Detergents_Paper |	Delicatessen |
|:-------:|:-----------:|:----:  |:--------:|:--------:|:-------------------:|:-------------:|
|**mean** |	7523.0      | 4481.0 |	6339.0  |	1678.0 |	1927.5           |	       950.0 |

From this we can analyse the following:

- Segment 0 has above-mean spendings amount on the categories Fresh and Frozen, and below-mean spending on Milk,	Grocery, Detergents_Paper. This could be the profile of a Restaurant selling mostly fresh foods.

- Segment 1 on the other hand has an above-mean spendings on Milk, Grocery, Detergents_Paper and Delicatessen, and a below-mean spending on Fresh and Frozen. spendings on Milk, Grocery and Detergents & Paper and somewhat average spendings on Delicatessen. This could be the profile of a retail store.

### Question 9
*For each sample point, which customer segment from* ***Question 8*** *best represents it? Are the predictions for each sample point consistent with this?*

Run the code block below to find which cluster each sample point is predicted to be.


```python
# Display the predictions
for i, pred in enumerate(sample_preds):
    print "Sample point", i, "predicted to be in Cluster", pred
```

    Sample point 0 predicted to be in Cluster 1
    Sample point 1 predicted to be in Cluster 1
    Sample point 2 predicted to be in Cluster 0


**Answer:**

Let's first show the same data again.

|	|Fresh|	Milk|   Grocery|	Frozen|	Detergents_Paper|	Delicatessen|
|:-:|:-:  |:-:  |:-:       |:-:       |:-:              |:-:            |
|0  |44466|54259|55571     |	7782  |	24171           |           6465|
|1  |    9|1534 |	   7417|	   175|	            3468|             27|
|2  |22686|	 134|	    218|	  3157|	               9|            548|


Now lets see how good our predictions were:

**row0:** My previous guess for this data point was a big retailer. The output shows that it's assigned to segment 1 which is the expected cluster for this data point. Thus my predictions were correct.

**row1:** My previous guess for this data point was retailer. As we can see from the output, this data point was assigned to segment 1 which is also in line with my previous expectations. Thus my predictions were correct again.

**row2:** The data point on row 2 was believed to be some sort of fresh food restaurant. This establishment is characterized for having far below average on all points except for Fresh and Frozen, pointing strongly in a different direction than the other two. We can also see that from its low scores it strongly resembles segment 0 more then segment 1. The output shows my predictions were correct as the data point was assigned to segment 0. Thus my predictions for this third data point were also correct.

## Conclusion

In this final section, you will investigate ways that you can make use of the clustered data. First, you will consider how the different groups of customers, the ***customer segments***, may be affected differently by a specific delivery scheme. Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data. Finally, you will compare the ***customer segments*** to a hidden variable present in the data, to see whether the clustering identified certain relationships.

### Question 10
Companies will often run [A/B tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) when making small changes to their products or services to determine whether making that change will affect its customers positively or negatively. The wholesale distributor is considering changing its delivery service from currently 5 days a week to 3 days a week. However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. *How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would react positively to the change in delivery service?*  
**Hint:** Can we assume the change affects all customers equally? How can we determine which group of customers it affects the most?

**Answer:**

One can hypothesize that the product categories least affected by change would be Milk, Grocery, Frozen and Detergents_Paper since these are products that have an expiration date longer than 1 week. This would mean that customers that are primary buyers of these categories could be more open to longer waiting time between delivery. And judging from the table of the two customer segments we can see that Segment 1 is a more frequent buyer of Milk, Grocery, Frozen and Detergents_Paper and segment 0 a more frequent buyer of Fresh, than any other category.

|	         |Fresh |	Milk |   Grocery|	Frozen |	Detergents_Paper|	Delicatessen|
|:-:         |:-:   |:-:     |:-:       |:-:       |:-:                 |:-:            |
|Segment 0	 |8967.0| 1920.0 |	2437.0	|2081.0	   |309.0	            |741.0          |
|Segment 1	 |6079.0|7042.0	 |10241.0	|1275.0	   |3546.0	            |1159.0         |

However to make better predictions one would have to do additional filtering on the customer segments based on their buying habits, as many customers seem to have any obviously skewed buying habits. As a next step i would have recommended tests in the form of A/B-tests on the customer segments to evaluate the customers reactions.

### Question 11
Additional structure is derived from originally unlabeled data when using clustering techniques. Since each customer has a ***customer segment*** it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider *'customer segment'* as an **engineered feature** for the data. Assume the wholesale distributor recently acquired ten new customers and each provided estimates for anticipated annual spending of each product category. Knowing these estimates, the wholesale distributor wants to classify each new customer to a ***customer segment*** to determine the most appropriate delivery service.  
*How can the wholesale distributor label the new customers using only their estimated product spending and the* ***customer segment*** *data?*  
**Hint:** A supervised learner could be used to train on the original customers. What would be the target variable?

**Answer:**

By treating the cluster segments as labels we could use a supervised learning algorithm to train the algorithm to distinguish between the two clusters. If the accuracy is above a certain threshold we could apply the algorithm on the 10 new data points.

### Visualizing Underlying Distributions

At the beginning of this project, it was discussed that the `'Channel'` and `'Region'` features would be excluded from the dataset so that the customer product categories were emphasized in the analysis. By reintroducing the `'Channel'` feature to the dataset, an interesting structure emerges when considering the same PCA dimensionality reduction applied earlier to the original dataset.

Run the code block below to see how each data point is labeled either `'HoReCa'` (Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe) or `'Retail'` the reduced space. In addition, you will find the sample points are circled in the plot, which will identify their labeling.


```python
# Display the clustering results based on 'Channel' data
vs.channel_results(reduced_data, outliers, pca_samples)
```


![png](images/output_71_0.png)


### Question 12
*How well does the clustering algorithm and number of clusters you've chosen compare to this underlying distribution of Hotel/Restaurant/Cafe customers to Retailer customers? Are there customer segments that would be classified as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' by this distribution? Would you consider these classifications as consistent with your previous definition of the customer segments?*

**Answer:**

My data model seems to have captured the larger trend in the data, the silhouette score recommended 2 clusters which is also what is presented in the model above. Thus the cluster i developed is consistent with the new model, however, we can also clearly see that my model is not able to capture the nuances between the clusters, as many of the points overlap.

There are some data points that could be considered as purely 'Retailers' or 'Hotels/Restaurants/Cafes' in the distribution, but consists of only a few data points to the far left and far right. However there is considerable overlap in the true distribution as the majority of data points are somewhat ambiguous and do not clearly belong to one cluster or the other.
